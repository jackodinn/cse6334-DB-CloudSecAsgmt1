## How to run?
1. On Windows Server 2022 virtual machine, search "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" on the search bar, create a new rule.
2. In the new rule, select Port, then select TCP & Specific Local Ports, fill in 1433. This is your SSMS default port.
3. Next, Allow the connection, rule apply for all, name it as "Flask".
4. In your SSMS, Login as administrator, go to MYSERVER -> Databases and create database called "DataSec", then go back and click MYSERVER -> Security -> Logins and create a new login.
5. Name your new login as "flask", select SQL authentication and set your password as "Pa$$w0rd". Uncheck "Specify Old Password" & "Encorce password policy", then select your default database as "DataSec". 
6. Next, do not exit from create login, instead go to User Mapping tab. Map "flask" into DataSec, and grant role into "db_datareader", "db_datawriter", "db_ddladmin" and "db_owner".
7. Go to Status tab, grant permission to the database engine and enable login for this user.
8. Go back to the DataSec database you just created, right click into it and click properties, select Permissions page, browse "flask" and grant permission on "Connect". 
9. On your Virtualbox Manager, select your Win Server 2022 vm, go to settings, select network and check whichever has NAT attached. Once found, click Advanced, then Port Forwarding. Add a rule named "Flask", set TCP as protocol, put your ip as 127.0.0.1 and port as 1433 then click ok.
10. On your local machine, open Command Prompt and redirect the directory into whatever this directory is located, do "pip install -r requirements.txt".
11. Once installed, you can test your connection by running "test_conn.py". If it works, you may launch the python app.
